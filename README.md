# Copify - Spotify frontend clone 

Copify is a simple website with an almost identical frontend like Spotify.

It is a small school project used for educational purposes only and is written in HTML and CSS.

## Installation

Download and extract the files and open "index.html", preferably with chromium web browser.

## Usage

"index.html" is the main page. From it, navigate thru "search.html", "login.html" and "signup.html" by clicking on buttons that say Search, Login or Sign up. It is frontend only and is not capable of playing music or creating accounts.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

## Disclaimer

As mentioned, this is for educational purposes only. This website should not be perfect or identical to the original, nor should it function like it. That is not the goal. The point is to study Spotify's HTML structure and try to replicate it and also to learn how CSS is used to style website's elements.
